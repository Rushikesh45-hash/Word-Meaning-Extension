# 📘 Word Meaning Extension

A smart and helpful Chrome extension that provides the **meaning**, **definition**, and **example** of any selected word — directly on the webpage. It's ideal for students, developers, readers, and anyone who wants to quickly understand words while browsing.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🔍 **Instant Word Meaning on Right Click**

- 📖 **Includes:**
  - Meaning
  - Definition
  - Example sentence

- 🔁 **"Another Meaning" Button**  
  If the first meaning isn't clear, users can click **"Another Meaning"** to get a new explanation using that previous meaning — like a chain of simplified meanings.

- 📋 **Copy to Clipboard**  
  One-click **"Copy"** button to copy the meaning and use it elsewhere easily.

- 🧼 **Clean and Minimal UI**  
  A small, elegant popup shows up near the selected word without interrupting your browsing.
